# EVM 1.5 Transaction Types

## Introduction

The Telos Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatibility layer is a platform that allows
for the execution of Ethereum-compatible smart contracts on the Telos blockchain. It
provides a number of different types of transactions that can be used to interact with
these smart contracts.

## Types of Transactions

- Regular EVM Transactions: These are standard EVM transactions produced by tools like 
MetaMask. They have standard compliant EVM signature in the V R S fields and allow for
the transfer of value between accounts, and can also be used to invoke smart contract
methods.

- Native Deposit Transactions: These transactions are generated when a user deposits
Telos tokens from a native Telos account to a TEVM smart contract. This allows for the
transfer of Telos tokens into the EVM environment.

- EVM Withdraw Transactions: These transactions are generated when a user withdraws Telos 
tokens from an EVM address to a native Telos account. This allows for the transfer of
Telos tokens out of the EVM environment.

- Unsigned EVM Transactions: Each Telos native account can have an associated EVM address,
so they can produce EVM transactions without a standard EVM signature and use native
Telos signature for authentication.

Except for regular EVM transactions, we use a custom algorithm to determine the VRS fields of
transactions:

- The v field is set to a fixed value of 42, which is used as an arbitrary unique value.

- The r field is generated by taking the native block hash, converting it to a BN (big
number) object, adding the transaction index as a BN, and then converting the result back
to a hex string. This creates a unique value that is based on both the block hash and the
transaction index.

- The s field is generated by taking the sender address, converting it to lowercase,
removing the '0x' prefix, padding the end with zeroes to a total length of 64 characters,
and then converting it back to a hex string. This creates a unique value that is based on
the sender address.

This function generates unique VRS fields by combining the blockhash, transaction index and the sender address, and using those values to generate the VRS fields, this way, this function ensures that the VRS fields are unique and will avoid duplicates.

## Conclusion

The Telos EVM compatibility layer provides a number of different types of transactions
that can be used to interact with smart contracts. Understanding the different types of
transactions and when to use them is essential for building and interacting with smart
contracts on the Telos blockchain.
